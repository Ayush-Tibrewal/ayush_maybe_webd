```

/* This is an example of attribute selector. The specificity of this selector is 10 */
        [data-x=a] {
            color: maroon;
        }
         <div>
        <h1 class="yellow cred cpurple" data-x="a">CSS Specificity</h1>
    </div>

In CSS, vm is not a standard unit. You might be thinking of vw and vh, which are viewport-relative units. These units are useful for creating responsive designs that adapt to the size of the viewport.
